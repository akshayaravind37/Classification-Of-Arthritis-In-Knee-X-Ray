# Classification-Of-Arthritis-In-Knee-X-Ray
The most frequent kind of joint inflammation in bones is arthritis. A person with arthritis has a greater risk of developing early impairment and joint abnormalities.
The damage to the joints might be minimized with early arthritis diagnosis and therapy. There are now many extensively used therapy methods for this disease's diagnosis.
The analysis heavily relies on imaging of the afflicted joints. The feature extracted from digital X-ray pictures using a local binary pattern is used in this paper to
explore the classification of arthritis using KNN and Bayesian classifiers.
